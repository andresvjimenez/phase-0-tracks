// A) Each line in Javascript ends with a semicolon ";"
// B) Ruby's nil = Javascript's null
// C) In Javascript, datatypes are printed with:  console.log("")
// D) In Javascript variables are declared with "var" followed by the name of the variable
// E) Ruby's def = Javascript's function 
// F) In Javascript, all functions (declared and/or called) need to be followed by parenthesis (with or without parameters)


//a function that takes a string as a parameter and reverses the string. reverse("hello"), for example, should return "olleh". 
//Remember that you can add strings in JavaScript, so '' + 'a' would result in the string 'a'
// Add driver code that calls the function in order to reverse a string of your choice (as long as it's not a palindrome!), 
//and stores the result of the function in a variable.
//Add driver code that prints the variable if some condition is true. The condition can be a silly one, like 1 == 1.


reverse("hello")


function("")


// add two numbers
function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

// say hello
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}

console.log(add(5,3));
