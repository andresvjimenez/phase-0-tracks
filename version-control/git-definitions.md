# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control? Version control is the ability to save, merge, or undo changes to repository projects. It is useful because when a developer errs and faces re-examining every line of code to make sure everything is correct (how it previously was), he/she can just pull an older version (without hassling with editing it) of the file from the project repository.  
* What is a branch and why would you use one? A branch is a alternate version of a master branch that developers may or may not merge with the master branch depending on how it improves the project.
* What is a commit?  A commit is a save point for a repository project that can be regressed to if future errs call for it. What makes a good commit message?  A good commit message briefly but succinctly describes (in present-tense) the changes made to the file.
* What is a merge conflict?  A merge conflict is when the master branch has code aspects that make it unable to reconcile with edits on a feature branch.
